## Description

This is a web-based Stock Analysis AI Tool designed to provide users with fundamental and technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and comparative analysis of stocks. Leveraging the power of AI, specifically the Gemini API, along with various financial data sources and a sentiment analysis model, the tool offers insights to aid in stock research. The application features a Python backend and a React frontend, providing a user-friendly interface.

## Features

The tool is structured around three main functionalities:

### 1. Stock Analysis

This page allows users to get a comprehensive analysis of a single stock.

-   **User Input:** The user enters a stock ticker symbol in the frontend.
-   **Backend Processing:** The input is sent to the `app.py` backend.
-   **Data Fetching:** `app.py` calls the `single_stock.py` module. Within `single_stock.py`, the `analyze_stock` function fetches:
    -   Fundamental data using `yfinance` (via `fundamental.py`).
    -   Technical data using `yfinance` and `tradingview_ta` (via `technical.py`).
-   **AI Analysis:** The fetched fundamental and technical data are sent to the Gemini API within `single_stock.py` using the `api` and `google.generativeai` modules.
-   **Result Display:** The analysis generated by the Gemini API is sent back through `app.py` to the React frontend for display.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis

This feature provides insights into the market sentiment surrounding a specific stock based on recent news.

-   **User Input:** The user enters a stock ticker or selects from a predefined group of stocks in the frontend.
-   **Backend Processing:** The ticker is sent to the backend.
-   **News Fetching:** The backend fetches news articles related to the stock using the Google News API.
-   **Sentiment Calculation:** The fetched news articles are sent to `sentiment.py`, which uses the FinBERT model to determine the sentiment (negative, positive, or neutral) for each article.
-   **Result Display:** The aggregated sentiment analysis results (proportion of negative, positive, and neutral news) are sent back to the frontend.

### 3. Stock Comparison

This page enables users to compare two stocks based on their fundamental and technical data.

-   **User Input:** The user enters two stock ticker symbols in the frontend.
-   **Backend Processing:** The tickers are sent to `app.py`.
-   **Data Fetching:** `app.py` calls the `compare.py` module. `compare.py` fetches fundamental and technical data for both stocks by utilizing `fundamental.py` and `technical.py`.
-   **AI Comparison:** The fetched data for both stocks is sent to the Gemini API within `compare.py`.
-   **Result Display:** The comparative analysis from the Gemini API is sent back through `app.py` to the frontend using Flask, `flask_cors`, and `CORS`.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a combination of backend and frontend technologies:

### Backend (Python)

-   **Flask:** Web framework to handle API requests.
-   **Flask-CORS (CORS):** Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
-   **yfinance:** Library to fetch historical market data.
-   **tradingview_ta:** Library to fetch technical analysis indicators from TradingView.
-   **google-generativeai:** Python client for the Gemini API.
-   **FinBERT Model:** Used in `sentiment.py` for financial sentiment analysis.
-   **Google News API:** Used to fetch news articles for sentiment analysis.
-   **`api` and `google.generativeai` modules:** For interacting with the Gemini API.
-   **`collections`, `requests`, `transformer`:** Other necessary libraries for data handling and processing.

### Frontend (React)

-   **Create React App:** Boilerplate for the React application.
-   **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **React Router:** For navigation between different pages (`app.js`, `aboutus.js`, `compare.js`, `login.js`, `news.js`, `index.js`, `profile.js`, `mainpage.js`, `protectedroute.js`, `registration.js`, `sentiment.js`, `support.js`).
-   **CSS Modules/Files:** For styling each component (implicitly mentioned for most `.js` files).
-   **Node Modules:** Project dependencies managed by npm or yarn.
-   **`server.js`:** Handles the demo login functionality using local storage (Note: This is a demo and does not use a database).

## Installation

To set up and run the Stock Analysis AI Tool locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mavicop/stock-analysis-tools-using-gemini-api-and-hugging-face-model.git](https://github.com/mavicop/stock-analysis-tools-using-gemini-api-and-hugging-face-model.git)
    cd stock-analysis-tools-using-gemini-api-and-hugging-face-model
    ```

2.  **Set up the backend:**
    -   Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    -   Install the required Python packages:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        (You may need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all Python dependencies).
    -   Obtain API keys for:
        -   Gemini API
        -   Google News API
    -   Set up environment variables for your API keys. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following format:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        GOOGLE_NEWS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_NEWS_API_KEY
        ```
        Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` and `YOUR_GOOGLE_NEWS_API_KEY` with your actual keys.

3.  **Set up the frontend:**
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` directory (or the directory containing your `create-react-app` code).
    -   Install the required Node.js packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        yarn install
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    -   Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    -   Run the Flask application:
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    -   Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    -   Run the React application:
        ```bash
        npm start
        # or
        yarn start
        ```

3.  Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the address where the React app is running).
